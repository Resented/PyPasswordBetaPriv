this is PPT(maybe renamed later) a new terminal.
just remember this is only the alpha version of PPT.
PPT is a terminal. you can calculate stuff,write and read to files,has a task-killing system and has various more other not so useful commands
one of the most useful command is .r, is refreshes the terminal and automatically applies changes you've made to the terminal. it already has a bit of tutorials in it however im
still working on those-
